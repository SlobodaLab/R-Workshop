## Sloboda Lab R Workshop

June 27 and July 4, 2022

### General Info

These workshops will borrow heavily from Software Carpentry workshops (see [here](https://jcszamosi.github.io/2017-07-27-McMaster/)) but are aimed at learning how to use R for specific analyses that are common in the Sloboda Lab. You do not need to have any previous knowledge of R to participate. 

**Requirements:** A laptop with running a Windows or Mac operating system on which you have administrative priviledges. Starting June 27th you must have all the required software installed. If you would like help installing any of this software, please attend the software installation party on June 20th after lab meeting. 

## R Setup
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

If you have previously installed R and/or RStudio, please make sure if at all possible that you have the most up-to-date versions. If your current R version is 3.2.5 or older, you will need to re-install packages and will get the latest versions of all packages by default; please be careful if you depend on a particular release of a package.

**Windows:**

Install R by downloading and running [this .exe file](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/index.html). Also, please install [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). Note that if you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later, for example when installing R packages.

**Mac OS:**
