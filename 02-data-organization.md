The most common mistake made is treating spreadsheet programs like lab notebooks, that is,
relying on context, notes in the margin,
spatial layout of data and fields to convey information. As humans, we
can (usually) interpret these things, but computers don't view information the same way.

This is why itâ€™s extremely important to set up well-formatted
tables - before you even start entering data from
your very first preliminary experiment. Data organization is the
foundation of your research project. It can make it easier or harder
to work with your data throughout your analysis, so it's worth
thinking about when you're doing your data entry or setting up your
experiment. You can set things up in different ways in spreadsheets,
but some of these choices can limit your ability to work with the data in other programs or
have the you-of-6-months-from-now or your collaborator work with the
data.

### Keeping track of your analyses

When you're working with spreadsheets, during data clean up or analyses, it's
very easy to end up with a spreadsheet that looks very different from the one
you started with. In order to be able to reproduce your analyses or figure out
what you did when Reviewer #3 asks for a different analysis, you should

- create a new file with your cleaned or analyzed data. Don't modify
the original dataset, or you will never know where you started!
- keep track of the steps you took in your clean up or analysis. You should track 
these steps as you would any step in an experiment. We recommend that you 
do this in a plain text file stored in the same folder as the data file. 

### Structuring data in spreadsheets


The cardinal rule of using spreadsheet programs for data is to keep it "tidy":

1. Put all your variables in columns - the thing you're measuring,
   like 'weight' or 'temperature'.
2. Put each observation in its own row.
3. Don't combine multiple pieces of information in one
   cell. Sometimes it just seems like one thing, but think if that's
   the only way you'll want to be able to use or sort that data.
4. Leave the raw data raw - don't change it!
5. Export the cleaned data to a text-based format like CSV (comma-separated values) format. This
   ensures that anyone can use the data, and is required by
   most data repositories.
   
### Columns for variables and rows for observations

The rule of thumb, when setting up a datasheet, is columns =
variables, rows = observations, cells = data (values).
