 ### Learning Objectives

 * Produce scatter plots, boxplots, and time series plots using ggplot.
 * Set universal plot settings.
 * Describe what faceting is and apply faceting in ggplot.
 * Modify the aesthetics of an existing ggplot plot (including axis labels and color).
 * Build complex and customized plots from data in a data frame.

**`ggplot2`** is included in the **`tidyverse`** package and will be automatically loaded when you run `load.project()` 
if you have load_libraries set to TRUE in your global.dcf config file. 

## Plotting with **`ggplot2`**

**`ggplot2`** is a plotting package that provides helpful commands to create complex plots
from data in a data frame. 

**`ggplot2`** refers to the name of the package itself. When using the package we use the
function **`ggplot()`** to generate the plots, and so references to using the function will
be referred to as **`ggplot()`** and the package as a whole as **`ggplot2`** 

ggplot graphics are built layer by layer by adding new elements. Adding layers in
this fashion allows for extensive flexibility and customization of plots. Layers
are added using the `+` operator. 

To build a ggplot:

- pipe your dataframe into the `ggplot()` function

```{r}
mouse_data %>%
  ggplot()
```

- define an aesthetic mapping (using the aesthetic (`aes`) function), by
selecting the variables to be plotted and specifying how to present them in the
graph, e.g., as x/y positions or characteristics such as size, shape, color, etc. 

```{r}
mouse_data %>%
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = diet, y = weight_gain)
```

- add 'geoms' â€“ graphical representations of the data in the plot (points,
  lines, bars). **`ggplot2`** offers many different geoms; we will use some
  common ones today, including:

  * `geom_point()` for scatter plots, dot plots, etc.
  * `geom_boxplot()` for, well, boxplots!
  * `geom_line()` for trend lines, time series, etc.  

```{r}
mouse_data %>%
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = diet, y = weight_gain)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

**Notes**

- Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function can be seen by any geom layers
  that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings). This includes the x-
  and y-axis you set up in `aes()`.
- You can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the
  aesthetics defined globally in the `ggplot()` function.
- The `+` sign used to add layers must be placed at the end of each line
  containing a layer. If, instead, the `+` sign is added in the line before the
  other layer, **`ggplot2`** will not add the new layer and will return an error
  message.
  
  ```{r, ggplot-with-plus-position, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This is the correct syntax for adding layers
plot +
  geom_point()
# This will not add the new layer and will return an error message
plot
  + geom_point()
```

## Building your plots iteratively

Building plots with **`ggplot2`** is typically an iterative process. We start by
defining the dataset we'll use, lay out the axes, and choose a geom:

```{r}
mouse_data %>%
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = diet, y = weight_gain)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Then, we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it. For
instance, we can add transparency (`alpha`) to avoid overplotting:

```{r}
mouse_data %>%
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = diet, y = weight_gain)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7)
```

We can also add colors for all the points:

```{r}
mouse_data %>%
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = diet, y = weight_gain)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, colour = "blue")
```

Or to color each species in the plot differently, you could use a vector as an input to the argument **colour**. **`ggplot2`** will provide a different color corresponding to different values in the vector. Here is an example where we color with **`diet`**:


```{r}
mouse_data %>%
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = diet, y = weight_gain, colour = diet)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7)
```

**Notes**

- Any aesthetic changes (colour, shape, size, etc) that **map** to the dataframe (e.g. colour by diet) have to go **inside** the `aes()` funciton.
- Any aesthetic changes that are **idependent** of the dataframe (e.g. alpha/transparency) go **outside** the `aes()` function
